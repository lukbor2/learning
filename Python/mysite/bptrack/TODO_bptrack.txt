#TODO: Look at the TODOs in each file.

#TODO: Use bootstrap to add some styling in a quick way.

#TODO: Page with a list of all patients. From there edit, add and delete a patient.
       From the same page I should be able to go to another page which shows a list of all BP measures for the given patient.
       And from there I should be able to edit, add and delete a bp measure for that patient.
