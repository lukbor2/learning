#TODO:	Create a form and use it in the PatientCreate view.

#TODO:	Look at the TODOs in each file.

#TODO:	Use bootstrap to add some styling in a quick way.
		[DONE!, I've added bootstrap to a base template which I import in all other templates.]

#TODO:	Page with a list of all patients. From there edit, add and delete a patient.
		Try to have one command per each patient (i.e. a link to edit, a link to delete) and commands who act on multiple selected records.
		From the same page I should be able to go to another page which shows a list of all BP measures for the given patient.
		And from there I should be able to edit, add and delete a bp measure for that patient.

#TODO:	find a way to define labels for each field, for example in the model, so those labels can be used everywhere. For example in table headings.
		[DONE!, I've used a package called django-etc which has a custom tag which can be used in the html templates.]
