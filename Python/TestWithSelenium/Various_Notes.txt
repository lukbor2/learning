*** SIZE OF A WEB PAGE ***

I would like to test the time needed to load a page and look at the size of the page too.
I have a script to calculate the load time and in general there are many ways to do it, but I don't know how to calculate the size of a web page.
Some links to pages talking about calculating the size of a webpage:

It looks like in the head of an html page there is an attribute carrying the size of the page.
