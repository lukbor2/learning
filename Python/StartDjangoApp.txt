From Cloud9, the way to start a django web app is this:

    python3 manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT

Then use the Preview to use the app in the Cloud9 browser.
Note that in the URL the port number is NOT needed.
For example the URL will look like this.

    https://learning-lukbor2.c9.io/admin/
    
I just left the preview to select the url and then changed the last part adding, for example, admin.
