learning
========

I would like to use this repository to store the projects I use for learning so I can access them from different development environments.

From Cloud9
===========

	For existing files:

	git commit -a -m "A message here"
	git push

	For new files

	git add folder/filename
	git commit -a -m "A message here"
	git push

From Eclipse
============

	Right click the project
	Select Team and then Commit
	In one of the windows which follow select the master branch and
	use the option "force commit"
	Then click on the button "Commit and Push"
