After generating the app, before moving forward
I had to do some additional stpes not listed in the tutorial.

grunt serve did not work so from the directory where the project is
I did:

sudo npm cache clean
sudo npm install grunt --save-dev

Then I had to fix bower. Still staying in the directory where the project
is I did:

sudo npm install
sudo npm install -g bower
bower install


Then I had to fix karma. Still staying in the directory where the project is
I did:

sudo npm install grunt-karma --save-dev
sudo npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev
npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev

Basically it seems grunt, bower and karma need to be installed in the directory
where the project is
