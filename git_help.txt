1) Go to the folder where you want to create a repository.

        git init

   Repository is initialized and the hidden folder .git is created.

2) Check the status

        git status

   It reveals whether there are non-tracked files. i.e. files which need to be added to the repository.

3) Add files to the repository

        git add <filename>
        git add -A .

   The last commmand adds all files and folders below the current one.
